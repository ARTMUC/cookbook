# COOKBOOK APP - IT'S A BLOG TYPE APP TO UPLOAD RECIPES

# PURPOSE OF CREATING THE APP
I made this APP to learn React, Express and handling Databases.
At first I was using Mongo with Mongoose but the switched to SQL (you can still find commented files with queries to Mongoose - left for learning purposes).
I did a lot of refactoring trying my best to create code that is easy to read. 

## STACK:
- React
- Express
- MySQL DB (raw queries)

## WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT?
- You can add/edit/remove recipes with ingredients and photos.
- You can share your recipes with other Users.
- You can create User account and you will receive confirmation email.
- You can login and receive JWT to stay logged in.
